# Descent Mode

This is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that allow your capsules
to be re-oriented on atmospheric entry, so that aerodynamics forces
will keep it at an angle, making it generate lift and experience
less g-forces than doing pure ballistic reentry.

Less g-forces will make your crew members and tourists more happy
when they return from orbit back home.
