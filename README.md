# Descent Mode

This is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that allow your capsules
to be re-oriented on atmospheric entry, so that aerodynamics forces
will keep it at an angle, making it generate lift and experience
less g-forces than doing pure ballistic reentry.

Less g-forces will make your crew members and tourists more happy
when they return from orbit back home.

Based on Realism Overhaul's
[CoMShifter](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/blob/master/Source/CoMShifter.cs)
(currently just copied the code over and renamed the namespace,
but possibly more features will be added in the future).

## Installation

Copy the DescentMode directory inside your GameData

## Usage

* Right click you capsule and select "Turn Descent Mode On".
* Orient you capsule to retrograde and rotate it such as the ground
  (brown) is at the top of your navball, and the sky (blue) is at the bottom
  (180 degrees roll).
  This is different from the original Realism Overhaul setup, where you have
  to set 0 roll, because it 1) allows your kerbals to see their planet
  in the window and 2) makes better lift for mk1-2 pod with Ven's Stock Part
  Revamp and FAR.
* Enjoy your descent.
